# Encryption And Decryption
This projet is about the encryption and decryption by the Caesor Ciphor method and I have also used some modified version of it which can encrypt and decrypt all the printable characters and This project is given by SkillCraft Technology in my Internship of CyberSecurity

# File 1 (Caesor_Ciphor.py)
It encrypts and decrypts the all alphabets which come in 1 to 26 and even is the alphabet is capital or small .... It uses the Caesor_Ciphor Method to encrypts and decrypts by shifting letters in the alphabet.Like if we shift the characters by 2 then the alphats will shift to the next 2nd alphabet like 'A' :- 'C' and it will goes until the last alphabet is encrypted and then finally all the characters will add and shown as the encrypted output.
And same goes with decryption it will shift the letter 2 step back like 'C' :- 'A' .... same process until the last alphabet
# File 2 (Caesor_Ciphor.py(Modified))
In this file I just modified that it will do with all the printable characters with whitespace too.But the method is same as Caesor_Ciphor
